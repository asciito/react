# Expenses Control

The expenses control it's a project from the course: **React - La Gu√≠a Completa: Hooks, Context, Redux, MERN +15 Apps** taught by *Juan de la Torre*.
The whole project is written in english (except the css, 'cuzis delivered by Juan in the project material).

At the end of the project I will refactor the entire code to make it more readable.

## Notes
